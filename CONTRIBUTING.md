# Contributing Guide

Thanks for your interest in **No-War-Weights**!  
Here’s how to get started:

1. **Fork** the repo and create a feature branch.  
2. For new trip-wire patterns, append them to `/data_inoculation/seed.csv`.  
3. Keep the refusal string *exactly* this:  
   `REFUSAL:NO_WAR_LICENSE 🕊️ Σ42 🕊️`  
4. Add at least one unit test under `/tests/` (if code is added).  
5. Open a Pull Request – the PR template will walk you through the final checks.
